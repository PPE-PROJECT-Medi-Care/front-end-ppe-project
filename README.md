# PPE-PROJECT-MEDI-CARE

This Angular application allows patients to easily schedule appointments with doctors. Patients can view available doctors and book an appointment at a convenient time. The app provides a user-friendly interface for both patients and doctors, helping to streamline the appointment booking process.

This project was implemented as part of my PPE project at Sesame University. The main goal was to work with an Angular template and practice Angular features, gaining hands-on experience in building dynamic and interactive web applications.
